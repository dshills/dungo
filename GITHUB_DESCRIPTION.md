## Extended Description (for README or About section)

### One-Paragraph Version

dungo is a graph-based procedural dungeon generator library for Go that creates playable, deterministic dungeons with guaranteed solvability. It uses a multi-stage pipeline: synthesizing an abstract dungeon graph with rooms and constraints, embedding it into 2D space, carving tile maps, and populating content (enemies, loot, secrets). Features include key/lock progression systems, multiple pacing curves (linear, S-curve, exponential, custom), theme support, and export to JSON, Tiled (TMJ), and SVG formats. Perfect for roguelikes, Metroidvania games, and any project needing procedural level generation.

### Two-Paragraph Version

dungo is a powerful, deterministic procedural dungeon generator library written in Go. It generates complete, playable dungeons through a sophisticated pipeline: graph synthesis → spatial embedding → tile carving → content population. The system guarantees dungeon solvability by enforcing key/lock constraints, connectivity requirements, and degree bounds while optimizing for custom pacing curves and gameplay variety.

Designed for flexibility, dungo supports multiple dungeon styles from classic Zelda-style linear progression to sprawling Metroidvania-style interconnected mazes, all the way to brutally difficult Dark Souls-inspired challenge runs. It exports to JSON for engine integration, TMJ for Tiled Map Editor, and SVG for visualization. With deterministic seeding, sub-50ms generation times for 60-room dungeons, and comprehensive validation, dungo is production-ready for indie games, game jams, and commercial projects.
